# Hi! # 
I'm Greg Freedman Ellis. I'm interested in data, public health, programming and technology.

Most recently I worked at the Iowa Department of Public Health, 
split between Oral Health Center where I helped develop and implement an
Evaluation Plan and the PRAMS survey, where I led analysis on our survey of 
women post-partum. Before that, I worked at the Institute for Health 
Metrics and Evaluation where I helped  estimate risk factor burden for the 
Global Burden of Disease.

Some projects that have been keeping me busy lately are: 
the R package [srvyr](http://github.com/gergness/srvyr), which brings dplyr's syntax to analysis of 
complex survey data, and hopefully details on a few more coming to the 
[blog here](/blog) soon (hopefully).

I'm currently looking for a job, here's a [pdf resume](/about/gdfe_resume.pdf). If you think I'm a good fit for a position or project, please 
[get in touch](mailto:gdfe.co.mail@gmail.com).

This site is a learning project, so it's based on a lot of other people's 
work, find out more details [here](/about/colophon).
