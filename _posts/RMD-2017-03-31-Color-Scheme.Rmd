```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "images/blog/2017-03-31/",
  retina = TRUE
)
knitr::opts_knit$set(base.dir = "../", 
                     base.url = "/")
```


I spent an embarassingly long time trying to come up with the color scheme for this website. I swear I didn't realize that it is the default colors for a 2 group graph in ggplot2

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt, group = am, color = factor(am))) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```
