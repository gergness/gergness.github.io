A project that's been on my mind lately is to make a map of the Twin Cities 
to hang on the wall. I've always thought maps are pretty and the visualization 
of data feels like a fun way to try to have a more artistic outlet than I've 
traditionally been able to find.

## The inspiration ##

I think the idea for using maps as an art project come from this guy's 
[amazing laser-cut wood hanging](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/3yenuu/i_laser_cut_a_topo_map_of_my_hometown_of_portland/).

Since I'm hoping to have all the fiddly parts be in the digital realm, 
I immediatley ruled out wood-cutting. So, looking for beautiful maps, I found 
[this series](http://beautifuldecay.com/2015/08/31/anna-bellmans-cut-paper-street-maps-puts-minimalist-spin-cartography/) [or this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/d1/e5/d9/d1e5d96a56a7e269190dd75b8e40dbeb.jpg) of roads as line maps. I've also always been fond of those
typographic maps with neighborhood names [like](http://www.orkposters.com/minneapolis.html) [these](http://www.orkposters.com/saintpaul.html).

## Data ##

My initial ideas for data layers that could be included on the map are:

- Road data 
- Bike lanes 
- Water features
- Topography 
- Breweries

The first 3 seem like they could come from government sources, but would all be in the same format if they came from [Open Street Maps](https://openstreetmaps.org). The fourth should be easy enough from [USGS data](http://ngmdb.usgs.gov/maps/TopoView/), and a quick google search
revealed [this list of breweries](http://growlermag.com/minnesota-brewery-map/).
