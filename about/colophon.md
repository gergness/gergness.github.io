# Colophon # 

This site is made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), hosted on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) 
and the theme started as Akshay Argayl's 
[Jekyll Mono Theme](https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007/Jekyll-Mono), but
has been altered a bit.

Picking colors has always been a bit of a mystery to me, so I used
[pictalicious](www.pictaculous.com/) and [palletton](http://paletton.com/) to try to do so somewhat scientifically.
