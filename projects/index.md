## srvyr 

An R package that extends the programming style and idioms from the 
[dplyr](http://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr) package to the analysis 
of complex surveys so that code can be more consistent and concise. Uses 
the [survey](http://cran.r-project.org/package=survey) package to perform 
all survey related calculations.
